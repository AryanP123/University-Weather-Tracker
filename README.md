# University-Weather-Tracker
A JavaScript program that uses the Fetch API to get the current weather data of the university provided by the user.

This is a JavaScript program that uses the Fetch API to obtain the current weather data of a university that is input by the user. It uses public APIs to fetch the weather data, latitude and longitude coordinates, and location information respectively.

I have written code for two specific universities: University of Massachusetts Amherst and University of California to compare the average weather.

Please note that one or more of these APIs may stop responding or working at any time, which could affect the functionality of the program.
